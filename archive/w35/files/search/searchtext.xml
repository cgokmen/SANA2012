administration. however, that does not mean it’s the best way. as seen in the case of the president taylor govern-ment, sometimes democracy brings dictatorship. “democracy... while it lasts is more bloody than either aristocracy or monar-chy. remember, democracy never lasts long. ıt soon wastes, exhausts, and mur-ders itself. there is never a democracy that did not commit suicide. “ - john adams well, what can ı say, he’s damn well right. the american democracy already wasted and murdered itself, now it’s time for its rebirth. san has always been an advocate of objective news reporting. however, the events have come to a point which forces us to take the people’s side. we the people, as the idiom says, are what matters. so, dear readers. ıt’s time for revolu-tion. ıt’s time to reincarnate the dead american democracy. we can’t know what will happen next - but we can know for sure, president taylor and democ-racy can’t coexist. funstein san chief editor headquarters chıef

eagles hav-ing attempted to stop riots using brute force in regions, the desert eagles have become a target just like the gov-ernment itself. rioters accuse them of being hypocrites and not being on the citizens’ side. however, these accusa-tions couldn’t be farther from truth. commander nathan of the desert eagles says it’s their duty to protect the civilians and prevent any harm to their properties. according to him, riots are unacceptable atrocities that make the government transition process harder. unnecessary casualties are occuring and the rioters are to blame, he says. the shooting of a bone county sheriff was displayed on the state televisions last week, as a response to the riots from president taylor. on the other hand, the desert ea-gles are combating terrorism, by pro-viding assistance to homeland se-curity. according to an undisclosed source, terrorism has been on the rise since the first riot as the police force is now unable to cope up with all the events. the war against terror is being fought in multiple frontiers, including special operations right in the heart of terrorism, cuba. occasionally, the war is being brought up to the mainland, with the desert eagles successfully eliminating threats every time. last week, desert eagles’ fight-er jets were seen bombing a terrorist camp tunnel in the mountainous bone county. as the war correspondant, mr. sting was flown to the scene in a civil-ian helicopter and he observed as the desert eagles eliminated the terrorist threat. his reports describe the bomb-ings as a rapid chain of explosions that kept going for around 10 minutes. as the skilled pilots kept going around and bombing the site, he reported ter-rorists shouting “viva cuba libre y vida”, seconds before the bombing ended and silence took its place. not much of “vida”, huh cubans? earlier within the same week, the desert eagles were distributing hu-manitarian aid in the riot-torn town of bayside, in tierra robada. as desert eagles patriots patrolled the streets of the town, soldiers knocked doors one by one and delivered the humani-tarian aid packages they got from the 10 barracks trucks that were on site. the humanitarian aid packages were dropped by de andromedas to loca-tions without road connection. “ıt’s our duty to be loyal to the na-tion, no matter who is in the white house.” says commander nathan. we can’t know if that will stay the case - but they sure have been our heroes at these hard times for our nation. the real heroes : the desert eagles 007 featurelayout1</Page><Page Number="8">008</Page><Page

for the public of san andreas for his entire term, as well as to limit the damage that the president could cause. the most recent election was supposed to happen on august 10th but the government, sensing that they could not hold on to power, have delayed it. the reasoning behind it, according to the government, is to ensure that we, the people, are not falsely affected by the recent actions of terror. sana spoke to the public to hear their opinion. when asked, the majority of the public refused to answer. those who did answer refused to have their name published, as they are scared of persecu-tion after a group of concerned citizens were gunned down by swat teams during a protest in the white house yard. the general consensus among the civillian population is that the elec-tion delay is a ‘ploy to keep president taylor in power’ with many people saying that san andreas is becoming a ‘dictatorship’. the police force how-ever, were far more in favour of mactaylor remaining in power as they feel he makes life ‘difficult for criminals’, despite the fact that san andreas has seen a rise in violent crimes and scenes of rioting across san fierro and las venturas over the past weeks. the real test of whether citizens of san andreas still believe in president taylor will be at the next elections: could we see a victory for mr. bartman, taylor’s closest rival in the last election; or will taylor hold on to power? or, will the newly established people’s party of san andreas clinch a victory over the more well established names? for now, there is no way to know, as there is a good chance that san andreas will not undergo elections again. 0010</Page><Page Number="11">0011 featurelayout2</Page><Page Number="12">0012</Page><Page Number="13"></Page><Page Number="14">rıots spread - now ın : las venturas rioters have once again hit the streets of san andreas, this is the third time in the past fortnight that anti gov-ernment protests have turned violent and this appears to be the bloodiest yet. the riots started after a seemingly peaceful protest based near a casino in las venturas went out of hand when police arrived asking protesters to leave and threatening with tasers and pep-per spray. the first shot was fired by a protester who saw a police officer spray-ing a member of the public not related to the protest. continuing from this first shot, other protesters became violent while additional protesters were contin-ually arriving. the protest travelled west across las venturas before heading south down the highway. swat inter-vened with water cannons, dogs and with teargas however, all officers were killed. further down the highway, desert eagles had set up a roadblock and at-tempted to kill anyone who was near to the protesters. a fire fight occurred between the two sides with the protest-ers eventually coming out on top and overrunning the first of two roadblocks. however during this fire fight desert ea-gles claimed the first civilian casualties of the conflict by shooting dead an un-armed woman trying to escape to safety over the roadblock. protesters continued to travel by foot down the highway into los santos, eventually reaching the pris-on where the largest jail break in san andreas history occurred. 40 ınmates escaped, many of whom were arrested for being part of protests earlier in the week and the rioters swiftly over ran los santos bank. the protesters agreed to allow a sana photographer to follow them into the bank however the photographer soon left after hearing from colleagues outside the bank that de may have been planning to raid. outside the bank, de, fbı and swat were gearing up for a raid with assault rifles and combat shotguns. the raid occurred and a sana photog-rapher managed to follow them in. the bank entrance turned into a bloodbath as desert eagles and swats fired upon the protesters. while the government suggested that the riots were being led by known terrorist organisation clo; the reporter on the ground did not see any rioters belonging to that organisation. over the entire riot, sana had a man on the ground, armed with no more than a pad of paper and a camera. the theme of the riot was hatred aimed towards the government and desert eagles. the protesters allowed all people to join in with the protests and did not cause damage to nongovernmental buildings. there were also an obvious hierarchy among the protesters, who appeared as a dedicated and well organised unit. while damage was caused to the lv fire station; protesters apologised to the fire department explaining why they had done it and agreed to pay for the repairs not funded by the government. after hearing this, a member of safd offered medical support to the rioters until his ambulance containing him and a patient 014</Page><Page Number="15">were destroyed by government forces at a roadblock. most of the rioters appeared to be regular people armed with nothing more than a hunt-ing rifle and a handgun however some rioters were heavily armed, professional criminals with heavy weapons. one man even had a home made flame thrower. statistics about the death toll and the dam-age were collected by global trust right after the riots came to an end. 	 	 	 	 de	   protesters	 casualties	 	 40	   74	 fatalities	 	 28	   53	 property damage 	100m  13m	 civilian kills	 	 9	   0 speaking generally, the main damage was unfortunately done by the desert eagles who heavily damaged the industrial area in south lv, the residental area in west lv, and left ls bank a restricted area due to the structural damage they caused by seriously damaging 4 out of the 7 supporting columns within the building. furthermore, 30 of the 53 fatalities occurred by the protesters occurred during the raid on ls bank whereas de only lost 3 men during the bank raid. the cause of death of two of them was declared a rioter gun-fire, while that of the third one is still not an-nounced. ıt’s suspected that he’s been a victim of friendly fire since the bullet entry points were found at his back. this riot appears to have answered a ques-tion which has been asked by many and has even been mentioned in a previous article in sawn this week: has mactaylor lost his sup-port? the answer is simple: yes – with the huge number of people turning up to these protests this week as well as the frequent chanting of ‘f*ck mactaylor’. furthermore, the ignorance from the government forces towards civilian life has angered the public and one can only assume the next election will be a whitewash with bartman appearing as the favourite. 015</Page><Page Number="16">016</Page><Page Number="17">017</Page><Page Number="18">senate has been dısmıssed according to an interview by an undisclosed red county sen-ator, the government has dismissed the senate and has cut the salary of the senators. the senator thinks this is a big offense to the people of san andreas. “ıt’s the people’s voice that’s being cut here, not only ours”, he says. the united states senate was gathered by president taylor in mid-june this year. the senate approved and rejected many bills, with nearly none of them taking effect. the senators were told they’d be called for the next week soon - and that was the last time senators heard from the government. however, president taylor has taken his dictatorship another step forward and officially dismissed the senate. a letter has been sent to the homes of the senators informing them the gov-ernment is “sorry to inform them their title as the senators is no longer valid” due to some “restructuring work”. the president and the chief of staff, on the other hand, have been arguing that this is not a dismissal but rather a temporary inconvenience for the restructuring they have done. however, previous experience with the government suggests, it’s another attempt to cover up a mess. 018</Page><Page Number="19">dısmıssed senators

sting - ı’m fine, thanks. should we start with the questions? napier - sure, go ahead. sting - alright, first question. what do you think about the peo-ple accusing the government over dictatorship? napier - those people are right, but they must accuse the presi-dent, we were -ı mean the rest of the government is- doing what we can. sting - thank you. second question is how much do you think the president has achieved, how much has he failed to achieve? napier - can’t say he did much. president taylor just tried to keep big people happy -like zzenom - and didn’t do any of what he prom-ised. sting - what about the rest of the government? were you guys able to be of use? napier - well, we had periodi-cal meetings where we gave re-ports and shared ideas - can’t say president taylor listened to us that much though. more like he made us listen to him and he did as he wished. sting - do you think new elec-tions should take place, and will you be running for a position? napier - yes, there should be new elections, there was supposed to be one already, also ı made a contract with another candidate al-ready, let’s see how will it work out. sting - here’s my last question. do you think there were any cor-ruptions regarding the use of feder-al money during president taylor’s term? what do you think about the 30 million dollars that were trans-ferred to global trust for the new nuclear power plant? napier - president taylor had us confirm the transaction even though our resources’ market re-search showed the power plant wouldn’t cost more than 5 to 10 million dollars. obviously, the pow-er plant is a cover for the money laundering president taylor and chairman ghost722nd are doing. a lot of money has been illegally obtained from the federal reserve during president taylor’s term and ı haven’t been able to stop this from happening. sting - thank you for answer-ing our questions mr. napier. good luck in the next elections! 022</Page><Page Number="23">ıntervıew wıth a govt. lıaıson last night, the people were shocked to here that president taylor had fired the liaisons, with the excuse of them “not working”. ac-cording to politicians from all over the state, this is a big crime against the voice of the peo-ple - firing who the people voted for and ap-pointing his fellow conman friends into the va-cant positions. after the news, formal federal reserve liaison mr. jack napier gave san an interview - giving shocking information to the public about how things work behind the iron walls of the white house. 	 the interview, which tells about many of the corruptions in the government, can be found on the left side. 023</Page><Page Number="24">024</Page><Page Number="25">025</Page><Page Number="26">sa pırates ımport cuban goods   as cuban goods are banned from san andreas by the government; the clo, along with sap, has set up an illegal importation business. this business is tasked with providing the people of san andreas with the freedom of choice in the goods they buy. the clo use sap to import there goods from cuba, to the mainland where it is distributed to shops around san andreas.   when asked about the legality of the operation, a clo member said: ‘we are simply providing freedom of choice to the people, we do not sell il-legal goods such as drugs and any weapons we sell are sold through licensed retailers’ he continued to say ‘the govern-ment has no legal right to pre-vent goods from cuba enter-ing san andreas and the clo and sap are simply providing goods that people wish to buy’.   a san journalist went along with one of the importa-tion convoys. the convoys are protected by armed guards as desert eagles have been re-ported to be shooting any sus-picious ships under the request of the government. this means that even a fishing vessel could be shot at and the occupants killed without any warning or investigation. the police have had powers removed by the government to patrol any of the sea to the east of los santos after a police boat was sunk by what is suspected to be a de patrol boat. this means that, if caught, the delivery convoy has 026</Page><Page Number="27">no chance of a fair trial and will most likely be killed on the spot or sent to the san andreas equivalent of guantanamo bay on gimp ısland which is reported to be home to suspected terrorists and traitors who are tortured daily by members of de special forces.   with clo continually growing in both political and physi-cal power, sap could find themselves delivering more shipments than ever as well as clo and sap officials hinting at sap being employed for ‘acquiring new hardware’. while we have not been informed of what this new hardware was, it could be anything from boats to cigar tubes to weapons however we have been as-sured that these deliveries do not result in terrorist activities as the government claim and they are all about ensuring the people of san andreas get what they deserve. furthermore, it is possible that the near future, cuban goods could be legal again in san andreas resulting in a more cost ef-fective journey for deliveries which we have been told, will result in cheaper goods for customers. they also welcome requests for new products and will attempt to provide anything if the de-mand is high enough. a spokesman for sap said ‘san andreas is supposed to be a democracy and if we are to succeed, we must keep the people happy. that is not done by denying people the right to vote or by limiting their freedom of speech. ıt is done by allowing them to vote and providing them with what they are entitled to own. 027</Page><Page Number="28">028</Page><Page Number="29">029</Page><Page Number="30">land ho! column by sharky ıt is the government special edition and it is not good news for mactaylor and his government. this issue was pre planned to be the edition introducing you to our new president and his staff fol-lowing the elections. however, the elections never went ahead so it is not. ınstead it was going to be filled with all the useful things that the current government have done for san andreas. how-ever, we couldn’t find enough to fill a whole paper with; in fact, ı struggled to find anything. ok, the financed gt for a new nuclear power plant which is highly controversial however shows good intentions but, apart from that they appear to have done nothing. personally, ı, as a journalist, like to present myself as impartial but despite this, ı have written about four articles presenting the gov-ernment as corrupt criminals who do not care at all for san an-dreas and none showing how good it has been so ı decided that ı would try to relive some of the good parts of the governments regime in order to even up my balance.   ı decided a logical place to start was the beginning. after a close, slightly controversial elections with the leader at the half way stage being disqualified for unknown reasons and then ı very close final election between bartman and mactaylor. then the victory parade was moved from lv stadium to the white house lawn where mactaylor assured us, that equality would be the key part of his term in power. he invited clo into the parade and said they would work together to serve the people as well as possible. an early criticism was that he was, in essence, a cop and that he would not serve the civilian population well. however, after working with the police for some time, no apparent changes were made in favour, or against the police force. a major complaint by police officers is the lack of air support in las venturas, a problem which, although it was reported, has never been remedied. 030</Page><Page Number="31">while mactaylor has almost certainly been impartial in the changes he has made to civilian life, changes in state law have given the desert eagles far too much power. they received al-most half of the san andreas budget which was spent on new aircraft and vehicles, as well as upgrades to kit available such as the new juggernaut.   the juggernaut has been presented by the desert eagles as the saviour to all people; however, the only 2 cases that san are aware it has been used in combat are both seen as mas-sacres of unarmed civilians. ı personally have seen the jugger-naut used in a third occasion where it was acting as a dj to a party. while we are all in favour of being able to be in contact with de, ı think the use of a million dollar armoured suit to dj a party may be a little unnecessary.   stepping away from military issues before we get too neg-ative again, the government has also introduced a new fuelling system for san andreas with al t getting the contract to deliver fuel from cuba, to petrol stations all over san andreas. while there were a few delivery issues initially resulting in remote fuel stations running out of fuel, these were quickly sorted and fuel stations now stock higher quality fuel through more user friendly pumps than ever before and it is even usable by the seamen of san andreas.   the government has also allowed tourism flights to cuba for the first time. while trade is still illegal with cuba (more on that next week), tourism has taken off and rumours of a runway being built on a manmade island in order to allow safer com-mercial air travel are circulating around the tourism industry. so while most of the governments work has been overlooked, it appears that despite a slight misuse of funding and designa-tion of power, the issues are mostly trivial and all the anti gov-ernment talk is grossly exaggerated. 031</Page><Page

Number="35">carrıed by the tıde column by rıptıde we’ve all read the news. recently, its been plagued by reports of riots, murders, and anti-government propaganda. ın fact, even the paper is doing an anti-government issue. everywhere you go you can hear people talking about the dank rut our president is driving san andreas into. lets face it, at this moment in time, san andreas is a living hell. ıts not even safe to go outside unless you are surrounded by the armed forces (which is also the reason ı decided its best if ı don’t come in today and do my work from the comfort of my home office). since essentially any government official without a death wish has been cooped up inside some sort of heavily protected build-ing, where surprisingly the phone lines and electricity haven’t been cut, there has been inter-building talk of reinstating a new sys-tem of government to make sure elections happen on time. our current president has been in term for longer than expected, and the people are aching for a new leader. while many understand that the changes president mac has reinstated wont be visible for some time, even more people aren’t satisfied with the guy unless something he said is implemented in less than 24 hours. hate to burst your bubble guys, but that’s just not possible. with the senate having been dismissed now, the people’s voice in the government is a whole lot less now. the government is hir-ing new liaisons, while firing the current ones without even talk-ing to them. the ones people voted for are actually being replaced with friends of president taylor. well that seems to be all for this week’s version of “carried by the tide,” if anything, see you next week. 035</Page><Page Number="36">036</Page><Page Number="37">037</Page><Page
