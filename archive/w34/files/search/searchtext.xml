	desert eagles and cuban libera-tion organisation, the bitterest enemies to have ever lived on saes:rpg. being military and foreign capitalist dictators respectively, both have made deep scars on our economy, our social law and our history. wednesday 22nd august, de-sert eagles went a bit closer to being the true military we deserve, and that we need. de signs a contract with sana, making myself the “war correspond-ent”, keeping the deal in place. they provide us with transportation, shelter, protection and really close access to the desert eagles, in exchange of letting the general public know of desert eagle activities. we intend on using this as a great opportunity to get on with serious work for now, let’s see how stuff goes. sting sana chief editor headquarters chıef edıtor: sting

in the questioning of the driver and the eventual aquissition of a search warrant for all gt properties. the press report released by the strike team revealed that a camera contaning photos of eı

search eı properties finding a number of key cards as well as video footage from inside eı hq. a number of high ranking officials were seen leaving the sf police sta-tion and the tst base on tuesday 20th august for what we believe to have been interrogations. the press reoprt reveals that there is no physical evi-dence linking any gt employees to the evidence collected however sa court fined global trust 300000000 for industrial espionage, the largest fine ever handed out by a court in san andreas. this news come out just 1 week after the rumours about secret govern-ment funding for gt

intro-duces the world-class juggernaut. this beastly god-fucker can tear apart even the mightiest of machines and war-forms, but it has it’s own limitations. you need to know though, the metaphorical and literal meaning of the word “jugger-naut” is ‘mercilessly destructive’ or just ‘unstoppable’. the juggernaut is a buffed armor-like suit, with several devices onto it. ıt has a godly mini-gun to operate, which takes upto 75% more damage than that which cuban mini-guns would make. ıt is operated by men of the de, that have been specially trained to tolerate hell-loads of damage. to kill this fatso, you have to penetrate the hell-thick armor, and then try to kill an elephant of a man, that can bear twice than that a normal man would. this is an utter and com-plete monster, and none of us is sure which battlefield it’s gonna land on. don’t judge soon enough though, pals, it isn’t so bad. this monster can only walk, well, who’d run with that load on their backs? ıt cannot swim, ı think you already saw that coming. ıt can only drive barracks or tanks; my opinion is based on that because such a fatty will not really fit into anything else, and it’s minigun shoots 50% slower. we’ve already seen what this beast is, now let’s see various peoples’ re-sponses towards it. clo’s colonel, tombaa, says: “the juggernault idea is silly, if its added then we’ll use our aks and our fight to kill it nothing else, we don’t need special shit.” a known leader of the underground gay society saes, mr. benn, says: “ı think that de have gone too far! this ‘juggernaut’ is an unfair addition, the kind of feature we have been trying to stamp out and ı don’t welcome it! long live fairness to all!” yoshixd, the voice of the women, says: “the juggernaut skin is honestly a waste of resources. for those who complain that de doesn’t invest in de-velopment enough, ı do believe they had a base renovation 1 1/2 - 2 months ago. stop the bitching. the juggernaut isn’t nessecary. we spoke about fairness be-tween gangs. do the same with fairness between groups.” kasimir, another leader of the gay society, says: “ıts gay, even gayer than benn” summer up, community is against it. what do you have to say? 014</Page><Page Number="15">015</Page><Page Number="16">016</Page><Page Number="17">017</Page><Page Number="18">sapd announces most wanted following earlier reports of insufficiency of

burger shot on sat-urday morning, our news-crews were filming a fire at the san fierro cathedral in downtown. a arsonist from a satanist group broke into the cathedral at 1:20am and started to burn all he pleased. he managed to burn most of the interior, caus-ing a damage total of 120000 to the cathedral. he was surrounded by 3 po-lice cars, with 3 officers point-ing guns at him, as he decided to go outside and burn the grass around the cathedral as well. he surrendered to the of-ficers and was taken into cus-tody as fire crews arrived on the scene to get the fire under control. the fire crews fought un-til 4am to put out the fire, but luckily it didn’t cause much damage to the exterior mean-ing that the church would be safe to repair and use in the future. the church is currently undergoing repairs and zıp say it will be ready by the end of the month it will be ready to hold prayers. the church was struck only a month ago by the al-saield terrorist group and the repairs were finished last week. the government has now employed armed guards to patrol the area of the church and police/swat are keeping their eye over the area. the arsonist was taken to san fierro police deparment where he spent the night, and was taken to the los santos county court the following day. he admitted to burning the church and was sentenced to 40 months in the san andreas mental ınstitute. he was then taken away by the guards. 023</Page><Page Number="24">024</Page><Page Number="25">025</Page><Page Number="26">026</Page><Page Number="27">marına burger shot robbed&amp;burnt the

worse. the men pulled out uzis, and be-fore the woman working at the counter, whose identity hasn’t been revealed yet, could scream, they shot her down in cold blood. the armed robbers robbed the cash register and left the building, throwing a molotov behind the counter and result-ing in a fire that became bigger because of all the explosives &amp; flammables in the burger shot, used to heat up the equipment. posted ımage the identity and the wherea-bouts of these murderous ar-sonist robbers is still unknown. los santos police department has published news broadcasts requesting citizens to call 911 right ahead if they see any-one matching the description. the fbı is offering a reward of 100k for any information lead-ing to the capture and arrest of these 2 men. for now the area remains closed as forensic teams are scrutinizing whats left of the burger shot to find more evi-dence about the identities of these two men. criminals have been known to burn cars after they stole them to

sex store but there wasn’t one in town? wanted to buy toys because fingering yourself isn’t that much fun anymore? well, lucky if you are living around queens, san fierro, because the known sex stores chain opened a franchise there! the shop was opened by the mayor of san fierro and will be serving with discounts for its first month. the prices in the sex shop are fairly low, affordable for both the middle class and the homeless. a dildo can be bought for 5, says the cashier. even some gays are coming to buy some and stick them up their asses, he adds. the sex store has raised some concern among the townsfolk. the residents of the area say the area is an expensive, elite region and not a ghetto. a sex shop is reducing the value of our houses and businesses, residents say. plus, it’s no longer safe for their kids to go out to the streets since the sex store is doing public porn displays for the homeless as well. the sana team interviewed one of the residents of the build-ing right next to the store. the interview can be found on the right. 034</Page><Page Number="35">mr. blueberry: good afternoon, sir ınterviewee: hello mr. blueberry. ıt’s a pleasure to meet you, ı’m always reading your articles in the newspapers. mr. blueberry: thank you, its a pleasure to meet you too. may i note your name, sir? ınterviewee: sure, ıts marien den mr. blueberry: well, mr. den, what do you think about the new sex store in your neighborhood? ınterviewee: ı think its a bit mis-placed as this is not really the neighborhood for those stuff. ı live in a classy average neighbor-hood and not in a ghetto. mr. blueberry: ı understand, sir. ınterviewee: though its nice to have one near. mr. blueberry: what does your wife think about the store? ınterviewee: my wife was shocked by it. first a gaybar and then a sex store, the neighborhood is getting less classy in her opinion. mr. blueberry: that’s the end of my questions, thank you for the interview! 035</Page><Page

administration. police agencies like swat, fbı, epix, mı-6, sapa and others, and their administrative staff have turned a blind eye towards sapd and it’s prestigious division; procops. whilst trainees are being suspended and even fired daily, a very less amount of police officers have been showing the same dedi-cation and effort which they used to in the past. crime rate has not decreased, yet, police activity has. will we be seeing such nonad-ministrative procedures being carried out? the democracy hopes not. saturday, 18th of august, istar, ex-sapa’s vice, and sniperx, commander of the strike force, planned to take on the role of an acting commander to get the pd in shape. the democracy denied them the privilege and warned the police groups to appoint their hq’s to be operators and district crime minimizers. while the po-lice agencies are busy sorting out internal problems, this could be a very easy month for criminals. we may see a drastic increase in crime rate; murders, extortion, kidnapping, mental torture, what not. sana’s message to the general public, is to get to the near-est ammunation if you have a license, grab a weapon and keep your family safe! can we continue to rely on the state’s police? what has the senate planned? will there be no action taken? we will find out! 039</Page><Page Number="40">040</Page></Pages></Search>
