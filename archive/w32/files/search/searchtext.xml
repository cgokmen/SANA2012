you leaders should be ashamed, to see the gang die again. take up the responsibility of upholding the gang and watching it die with dignity and a his-tory to be proud of, instead of watching it fail at a level one application. ıf ı were to be a leader of a now-dead gang, ı would take up the responsibility to make sure no one revived it, so that if that were to fail, new-comers wouldn’t see my gang as a failed revival, but a heritage, prestigious gang. take a flip, don’t spoil the trip. sana chief editor sting headquarters chıef edıtor: sting edıtor: funstein edıtor: blueberry journalısm edıtor: riptide marketıng edıtor: blueberry photography edıtor: johnny desıgn edıtor: ream design department ream tbds marketing department blueberry tony journalism department sting funstein mr. axe phazon mrjonas riptide spower qrux photography department johnny cobra stubrat killzone yzbyigit du[l]e sana team</Page><Page Number="4">004</Page><Page Number="5">rumor had it gt leader mr. ghost, along with gt board members were ne-gotiating a merger with the utc board of directors. that merger has taken place this week after the negotiations came to a successful end. after the merg-er. we interviewed mr. ghost, now the leader of the fastest growing company in all of sa, something to be proud of. after the merger, it is reported that gt acquired 15 new employees from utc making a total of 28 members. when it comes to the statistics, the data is stunning. mr. ghost, head of the merg-er believes they have close to 16 sea-soned employees among the ranks of gt. the board of gt now totals 9 board members, from both companies, with each having a vote on the company’s decision. while not willing to disclose any financial gains, mr. ghost did say, gt profits will rise approximately 4-6%, and utc will stay in possession of all of their properties. mr. ghost hopes this increase and the growth of gt will help the unemployment rates of san andreas drop significantly. ın other news, gt recently auctioned off their recycling plant to an undisclosed buyer and their salvaging plant to eco-activist company eden ınitiative for an undisclosed amount of money. mr. ghost says that these along with an attempt to clean up their dumping grounds in ls forests will help them become the “greener” company they are trying to become. gt is in full sup-port of a stock market proposal for sa, and is planning to support incumbent president mac taylor in the upcom-ing election, despite protests against his management. ın a press release to sana, mr. ghost has stated they have “economical interests” in supporting president mac taylor, especially if he gets re-elected. global trust skyrockets after merger with utc govt. secretly funds gt 30.000.000 a week an anonymous source from the agency reported to a few select mem-bers a confidential statement that con-tained a report that the government ıs secretly supplying global trust with an estimated amount of 30 million dollars a week. ıt is reported that high-rank-ing members had threatened presi-dent mactaylor to receive the funding. while the environmental effects of the extra factories built by global trust with the 30 million a week may not seem important to many, what is im-portant is that the government is fund-ing a corporation with more taxpayer money than most gangs, squads, and companies have in their bank account, hopefully this ludicrous privilege will be revoked when the next election comes upon us, as one of the con-firmed candidates is pro-environment nikolai, sponsored by eden ınitiative. there have been reports that a system of underground groups are planning to kidnap the president to stop funding to global trust, but none of these have been confirmed. 005 featurelayout1</Page><Page Number="6">panam &amp; airblue ıntroduce charter flights earlier this week, an agreement between pan american world airways and airblue was made, and the good news were announced - charter flights would start. the agreement, according to an undisclosed panam official, the agreement stipulates the airlines to fly charter flights everyday. all flights will be codeshares between panam and airblue, which means the workload, and the fuel maintenance price will be reduced to half, the official stated. the official says, contrary to popular belief, the two leading airline com-panies have decided to cooperate rather than compete - and the benefit to the community will be huge. the flights will be served by pan american’s fleet of airvan a340s and airblue’s fleet of doeing 737’s. a schedule will be published - the official says - alongside press meetings by both of the airlines’ managers. as a closing remark, the official said, he hopes to make the charter flights an official system with government support - an ideal shared by the manag-ers of both companies as well. 006</Page><Page Number="7">007 featurelayout2</Page><Page Number="8">008</Page><Page Number="9"></Page><Page Number="10">full scale rıots hıt san fıerro on tuesday the bayside was over-come by the biggest riot people have seen for months. this quiet, peaceful, scenic town turned to a bloody, destruc-tive war ground. ıt believed to have started in a gang leaders house in bay-side and developed into a full scale riot, almost as worst as the riot los santos experienced in 1992. the riot was belived to be lead by tuga thugs and biker boyz, the reason it was such a brutal battle was because these gangs had military grade weap-onry smuggled and stolen from various armories around the country. gangs from all over san andreas flocked to bayside to join in the criminal up rising. the police was alerted as they started to shoot at buildings and cars. many grenades and molotovs were thrown at buildings and cars. after members of the local police were shot down by the criminals, fed-erals and swat were called from san fierro to assist - bringing their water tanks. however these criminals were un-stopable. the desert eagles were quickly called in to assist as national guard. their tanks and fighter planes were given clearance to shoot on sight. the first tank to arrive in bayside started firing and criminals to disperse them. however the was damaged by grenades and was forced to be abandoned in a driveway when the rioters started to attack from above with explosives, the soldiers inside unsuccessfully tried to flee, ending up being shot down by the heavily armed rioters. fortunately the tank was too damaged for criminals to overtake it. as the desert eagles aircrafts started roaming the skies of bayside,  emergency services rushed innocent survivors to safety - the evacuation alarm went off for 30 minutes before the air attack started. the de planes swept down on those who were shooting. the main road into bayside was covered in rioters, trying to find a place to hide, and dead bodies. however, the plane at-tack didn’t last long - criminals were in places unaccessible by plane missiles and the planes were running out of fuel. as the desert eagle planes started to leave, swat reinforcements arrived,but criminal snipers had taken over the high points of the area and started to open fire on emergency vehicles in the dis-tance. the swat were outnumbered by the onslaught of terrorists, in effect they suffered a lot of casualties. the criminal said to be leading the riot was the notorious biker boyz leader, 010</Page><Page Number="11">apollo. he had practically became a ter-rorist leader as the army of blood thirsty rioters ran across the bridge towards san fierro, stopping several times to slaughter those who got in the way. the desert eagles from san fierro had quickly set up a huge blockade at the other end of the bridge to stop the rioters from reaching san fierro, and the northern districts had been evacuated for public safety. however, the blockade was blown up by the angry rioters and they kept moving into san fierro, climb-ing over the huge fence that de had setup in a attempt to stop them. but this time, they were trapped - on the other side of the fence the armed forces were getting ready! as soon as the rioters jumped over the fence, they were either detained or shot by the desert eagles and swats. many rioters were arrested and killed in the riot and the road to bayside has been littered with remains of the riot. the announced death toll is around a hundred, officials declared. the police and the fbı have been investigating the reasons behind the riot - and there has been no official expla-nation from the president who is being criticised for not doing his job. some are relating to the riots to the president, while on the other hand, some are relat-ing it to the cubans. 011</Page><Page Number="12">012</Page><Page Number="13">013</Page><Page Number="14">pan am ıntroduces doeıng 747 ın a press conference made by pan american world airways; chief execu-tive officer mr. yzbyigit announced that panam’s two ordered doeing 747s were delivered by the beginning of this week and ready for carrying passengers all over sa. “ıt’s an honor being the airline company with the largest planes.”, mr. yzbyigit stated. “we will be using those 747s for sf-ls and sf-lv charters start-ing next week.” the flag carrier airline of the united states, pan american world airways currently operates with its fleet of doe-ing 737 and airvan a321s. while these planes are also functional, they are too small in size and too slow in speed. similar, panam’s charter flight partner airblue uses doeing 737s as well. with the arrival of the 747s, panam flight capacity has been nearly doubled. first class services have been intro-duced for the first time, as well as the arrival of a new charter flight program which will be announced soon. with the arrival of panam’s a380s in the upcom-ing weeks, panam passenger capacity will be greatly increased as well as pas-senger comfort - and passengers will be able to fly more comfortably within san andreas. 014</Page><Page Number="15">015</Page><Page Number="16">016</Page><Page Number="17">017</Page><Page Number="18">018</Page><Page Number="19">rıght of speech? slaughter people from all over san andreas were protesting at the white house yard due to the president not fulfilling his promises made at the presidential election speech. frantic people could be seen waving banners and guns in the air, as a sign of antipathy against the white house. taking a look at the senate report it is easy to see the reason behind the protests. a lot of promises made, few promises executed. to name a few;   the “a roof for everyone” bill which was going to serve as a connec-tion between new san andreas citizens and the estate system, to make sure that everyone has access to a house, rich and poor.   offering more work to civilians, while at the same time increasing the average civilians’ income.   the suggestion of lowering gas taxes. the protest got out of hand later on the tuesday night, with people throwing stones, threatening local companies etc. the situation was thereafter “se-cured” by s.w.a.t. and other local police squads, and what the police department thought was needed to get the security to a decent level was done; resulting in gun firing in order to neutralize the threat. the protesters were violently slaughtered, one by one, without even an attempt to get them out safely. swat and secret service members could be seen firing their automatic weapons at the crowd as everyone started running. the protest ended as all of the protest-ers were shot down by the swat, some killed, some injured. the fact that the protest ended with a slaughter by the police raises a lot of thoughts; does the government want to limit the freedom of speech and shouldn’t protesting be a legal right? to be noted is that the government has been found attacking normal citizens for expressing their thoughts and not ad-justing themselves to the government. surely there’s a lot of questioning in this matter, and there’s a lot of thoughts going around in the city at the moment. the president was contacted for a comment, without success. 019</Page><Page Number="20">020</Page><Page Number="21">021</Page><Page Number="22">022</Page><Page Number="23">all load truckıng protests earlier last week, employees of all load trucking were seen locking up the entrance of the cuban oil refinery - claiming that delivering fuel to the gas stations was their job and their job only. cubans were authorized for fuel delivery as well without information - and ac-cording to all load trucking employees - they have been stealing their salary. they were threathening the government with keeping the refinery doors locked, and as a result, making all the gas sta-tions run out of fuel. for some weeks, all load truck-ing has been delivering the oil from the cuban oil refinery to gas stations all over san andreas with a good margin of profit on the price. ıt has been a topic of discussion whether this monopolistic approach is the right way - and it seems like cubans decided to get a share of it themselves. one of the protesters, mr. fabian, who is an al t official was interviewed by the sana chief editor, mr. sting. after some hours of protesting, chief of staff mr. delin arrived to scene with a panam helicopter, and effectively stopped the protests by convincing the protesters that the issue would be taken care of. as protesters started to leave the scene, the doors were unlocked and flow of trucks started to continue nor-mally. ınterview with mr. fabian from al t sting: mr.... fabin, or what was it? fabian: just fabian. sting: fabian, hello good gentleman. we’re here to champion the cause of news. could you tell us the main reason for this mutiny? fabian: the main reason is that cubans are now part of the fuel delivery job. sting : do you know the reason for this? fabian : mr. carlos doesn’t want to tell anything, he is just doing what he wants. cubans are terrorists, not civil-ians. this is meant for al t, the cubans are stealing our work, and money, and we will not accept that, that’s why we are here protesting. sting: cubans are a political power in san andreas. we are not in any fash-ion of speaking of it. fabian: we will keep protesting until they removed from it. sting: my next question is; why do you not feel the misery of the people?  you refuse to deliver fuel. pilots delay flights. cargo ships’ ruitine schedule is being disturbed. fabian: yes, that’s what we want. ıf we keep protesting, then they have to stop it! so they will remove themselves. sting: thank you mr. fabian. hope your problem gets solved before san andreas starts to suffer from this. 023</Page><Page Number="24">024</Page><Page Number="25">025</Page><Page Number="26">safd extınguıshes ındustrıal fıre on the sunday evening a wild fire broke out in a industrial property located south west of the easter bay ınternational airport. the fire is believed to be caused by the summer heat, but it may be arson according to the local police departments’ specu-lations; reasons are at the moment unclear. no workers were injured. san andreas fire department intervened quickly and contained the fire quickly in a matter of an hour. evidently the fire didn’t spread outside the factory. to be noted this isn’t the first fire of this sort, additional fires near the san fierro area have occurred, although these were most likely normal wildfires where the dead vegetation served as an accelerant in the warm summer heat. ınvestigators from the san andreas police dept. are in the process of determin-ing the cause of the fire, and is requesting people to report anything suspicious. 026</Page><Page Number="27">027</Page><Page Number="28">028</Page><Page Number="29">029</Page><Page Number="30">030</Page><Page Number="31">hurrıcane kenny strıkes at 1:00 am, the citizens we’re once again awoken to a flood alarm. with no warn-ing the flood began rising rapidly, quickly engulfing low lying areas such as bayside and the sf docks. nicked hurricane kenny, the flood was caused by heavy rains and reached record levels this season. according to eyewitness reports, the flood waters made both trust tower and ls bank tower, normally designated safe areas for flood victims, completely use-less, almost engulfing mt.chilliad in deep water. all road in sa were quickly flooded, stranding many people and leading to almost 100 of the 150 deaths caused by the flood. there were a reported number of suicides and one murder, an incident that oc-curred in the last big flood, leading many in sa to believe there is a serial killer that is related to floods on the loose. not many rescuers were able to respond due to the quick nature of the flood, which left many people stranded, and brought the number of injured citizens to ap-proximately 576. visibility was reduced to 10 m, and the flood receded from mount chilliad in a matter of seconds, an unusual occurance, which leaves researches won-dering whether the pollution caused by heavy ındustries has led to a new type of hurricane. one citizen recounts, “ when ı arrived back at my house, ı found a boat lying on top of the half-caved in roof, which is strange since my house is a decent amount inland.” this recent amount of hurricanes leads many to stop considering san an-dreas an earthquake prone zone, but rather a flood-prone zone. 031</Page><Page Number="32">032</Page><Page Number="33">arms &amp; drugs on the rıse with gang wars and violence everyday all over san andreas, the demand for il-legal guns and drugs is on a rise. everyday, more and more people are seen buying arms and drugs from the illegal dealers out there - which in effect damages the roots of our society and makes murders a part of daily life. with the increase of unrest in the state due to the inactivity of the president - citi-zens of san andreas are grabbing guns and joining the crowd. this is resulting with the shooting of many officers of the law and a lot of material damage to the city and the buildings. the police, on the other hand, is buying heavy weapons it normally can’t buy, to effectively neutralize any threats. the violence is getting more and more everyday, and it seems like the government has nothing to say, as always. on the other hand, the sales of drugs is on the rise as well! statistics show that nearly 1/3 of the citizens are addicted to drugs. the type of drugs include lsd and speed drugs, and some other less-used ones. the youth is being pulled to drugs by the dealers roaming in the cities - and it seems, the police has nothing to say to this either. drug dealers, possibly supplied by the cubans, will keep doing what they do and destroying the youth’s lives until we say no. 033</Page><Page Number="34">034</Page></Pages></Search>
